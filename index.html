        <p>I am the Learning Management System Manager at the Association for Energy Affordability, Inc. Outside of the responsibilities of running our LMS, I also create curriculum, which includes diagrams and images that convey difficult concepts. I use Sketchup and Adobe Illustrator to create these images. As a result of years of working on images, I consider my self to be a Sketchup Ninja! I have produced over a 1000 images that we use in our PowerPoint presentations. I have also have images published in our Multifamily Resource Guide. </p>

        <p>I am excited to be expanding my horizons by participating in this Coding Boot-camp.</p>  <!-- This is my bio summary -->
